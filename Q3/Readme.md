Using GLFW 3.3 | Using GLEW 2.1.0 | Using glm | Using SOIL2 | Keep B pressed to show Blinn phong | Keep F pressed to show directional light | When F is pressed continuously, it displays a combo of both directional and point light | Spotlight has been omitted, becuase it did not fit anywhere in the context and did not appear visibly different
